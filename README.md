# VMBuilder

This is a Dev Tool that helps create ViewModels faster in wpf when using the mvvm pattern.
Your welcome to change syntax in the solution but right now it is setup so that the ViewModel
you create should inherit from a ViewModelBase and the Base should use the INotifyChanged interface.

The delegate section is used by adding a DelegateCommand class somewhere in your solution.


All of the above makes absolutly no sense and you just want to start with mvvm copy the code out of ViewModelBase and DelegateCommand from
this solution. Make two class files somewhere in your solution and paste the code into each respectively.
